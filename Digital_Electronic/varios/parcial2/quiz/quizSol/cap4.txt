Instruction 1 Instruction 2
a. Overflow (EX)                                Invalid target address (EX)
b. Invalid data address (MEM)          No exceptions
 
4.25.2
The Mux that selects the next PC must have inputs added to it. Each input
is a constant address of an exception handler. The exception detectors must be
added to the appropriate pipeline stage and the outputs of these detectors must be
used to control the pre-PC Mux, and also to convert to nops instructions that are
already in the pipeline behind the exception-triggering instruction.
 
4.25.3
Instructions are fetched normally until the exception is detected. When the
exception is detected, all instructions that are in the pipeline after the first instruction
must be converted to nops. As a result, the second instruction never completes
and does not affect pipeline state. In the cycle that immediately follows the
cycle in which the exception is detected, the processor will fetch the fi rst instruction
of the exception handler.
